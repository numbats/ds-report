What is Data Science? What do you learn in Data Science? What kind of jobs do Data Scientists do? These are the type of questions we've encountered during social occasions and despite spending almost two years studying Business Analytics, we still struggle to give a definite answer.

Data Science, Business Analysis, and Data Analysis are new degrees that are created only in recent years thanks to the advance in technology and increasing demand for talent to work with data. The sudden rise of these degrees gave authorities little time to regulate them. Even the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO), the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Department of Home Affair are slow to catch up with their description.

After four months of gathering data, conducting analysis, and running models, we have attempted to define Data Science in Australia. Special thanks to Professor Di Cook and Professor Rob Hyndman for their support. A huge thank you to Dr. Emi Tanaka for the opportunity to work on such a special project and for her guidance throughout the whole thing.

This report is written jointly by Tsai-Chun Tsou and Xinrui Wang as part of the ETC5543 research project supervised by Dr. Emi Tanaka.
