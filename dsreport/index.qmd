# Preface {.unnumbered}

What is Data Science? What do you learn in your major and how is that different from Data Science? What kind of jobs do Data Scientists do? These are the type of questions I encountered during social occasions and despite spending almost two years studying Business Analytics, I have no clue how to answer. Data Science, Business Analysis, and Data Analysis are new degrees that are created only in recent years thanks to the advance in technology and increasing demand for talent to work with data. The sudden rise of these degrees gave authorities little time to regulate them and thus the actual definition can vary from places to places. With this in mind, this report is a result of exploratory data analysis to explore Data Science degrees across Australia Group of Eight universities and Data Scientist jobs around Australia.

This report is written jointly by Tsai-Chun Tsou and Xinrui Wang as part of the ETC5543 research project supervised by Dr. Emi Tanaka.
