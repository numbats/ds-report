    "text": "What is Data Science? What do you learn in your major and how is that different from Data Science? What kind of jobs do Data Scientists do? These are the type of questions I encountered during social occasions and despite spending almost two years studying Business Analytics, I have no clue how to answer. Data Science, Business Analysis, and Data Analysis are new degrees that are created only in recent years thanks to the advance in technology and increasing demand for talent to work with data. The sudden rise of these degrees gave authorities little time to regulate them and thus the actual definition can vary from places to places. With this in mind, this report is a result of exploratory data analysis to explore Data Science degrees across Australia Group of Eight universities and Data Scientist jobs around Australia.\nThis report is written jointly by Tsai-Chun Tsou and Xinrui Wang as part of the ETC5543 research project supervised by Dr. Emi Tanaka."

    "text": "In order to explore the Data Science degrees around Australia Universities, we compiled a list of Schools and the Data Science and related degrees they offered. Universities’ websites is scraped using R.\nTo start off the project, Professor Tanaka provided sample code for data scraping using Monash Handbook as example. Libraries rvest and rSelenium are two of the main tools. Initially, we studied her code and then tried to replicate her code to be applied to other university’s websites.\nThe flow of the data scrapping is as follow:\nDespite the process being similar for each University, we soon realize the process was going to be more challenging than expect."

The main website for the degree does contain the list of units that go into the degree.\nHowever, instead of having just one page with all the unit information, the link takes you to a page with different unit information depending on when the unit is offered and on what campus.\nI tried bypassing the pages by directly looking at the url of the final unit information page I want to be on. Unfortunately, the url is not designed or structured in a way which I am able to predict the url based on my unit code. With that said, my only option was to code the function to jump from pages to pages before landing on the right unit information page."
