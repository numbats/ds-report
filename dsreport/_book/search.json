    "text": "Universities are increasingly offering degrees that specialise in the so-called “Data Science” but what is Data Science and what skill are students expected to master in these degrees? The Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute (AMSI) and the Statistical Society of Australia (SSA) are conducting a review of role of of Data Science in Australia universities using surveys and focus groups. Our research attempts to tackle this topic by using data available from public resources. More specifically, we collected unit description and learning objectives/outcomes in Master of Data Science in the Group of Eight (Go8) Universities and job description of data scientist roles from seek.com.au available on from Kaggle. We used the data to decompose the core disciplines involved in the degree as well the type of skill sets that may be required. To expand on the initial exploratory data analysis, we also build Latent Dirichlet Allocation models to construct our own text corpus.\nFrom the exploratory data analysis, we observe a lack of homogeneity of the composition of unit structure across the Go8 universities. The inconsistent data metrics made it difficult to draw direct comparison between the employer data and university data. Nonetheless we were able to conclude that computational components are more prominent in data science for both the university and employer perspectives."

    "text": "There is no readily available data from Australian universities, so we had to collect our own data set through web scraping. The initial target was to collect data from all universities in Australia including both undergraduate and postgraduate courses, however, due to time constrain, the data collected for this project only contains Master of Data Science courses from the Group of Eight (Go8) universities. The data on job description (which we refer to as “employer data”) was retrieved from Data Scientist Job Listings on Kaggle.\nBy exploring the current situation and potentially a definition of Data Science in Australia from both the university and employer perspectives, the findings would help students and recruiters have a clearer picture of what to expect, as well as raising attentions and awareness to potential gaps between employer demands and university offerings.\n\nThe project was conducted in three main phases. The first phase is data collection (Chapter 2 & Chapter 3). Phase two is exploratory data analysis on the university data (Chapter 5) and on employer data (Chapter 6). Details of some pre-processing procedures are included in Chapter 4. Phase three is topic modelling (Chapter 7 & Chapter 8) where we built our own text corpus and group words from the data sets in attempt to find more meaningful results.\nOur concluding summary and thoughts on the future direction of this project is in Chapter 9."

    "text": "In order to explore the Data Science degrees in Australian Universities, we compiled a list of universities in Australia and the Data Science or related degrees they offered, then web scraped required information from each university’s website using the R programming language (R Core Team 2021). In total, we collected 298 units from eight postgraduate courses in Data Science across all Group of Eight (Go8) universities.\nTo start off the project, Dr. Tanaka provided sample code for data scraping using Monash Handbook as an example. Libraries rvest and RSelenium are two of the main tools. Initially, we studied her code and then tried to replicate her code to be applied to other university’s websites.\nThe flow of the data scraping is as follow (example code from uom-master-datasci.qmd):\n\nIdentify the main page (url) where the degree information is contained, which usually is the most updated version of the handbook.\n\nremDr$navigate(\"https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/courses/mc-datasc/course-structure\")\nsub_list <- read_html(remDr$getPageSource()[[1]])\n\nUse functions from rvest to retrieve all the course unit code (or course unit url).

Its html code is clearly labelled and anything you need to know about the degree or course can be found on the website. The same cannot be said about other universities.\nThe course descriptions on the handbook and universities’ website page are usually structured in a different manner, since the majority of the data is collected from universities’ handbooks, course descriptions are also extracted from handbooks for consistency purposes.\nIn addition, the required unit information listed above is not all available at the targeted universities. The handbook from University of New South Wales contains extremely limited information: unit overview is brief, unit requisites are only available for a few units, and unit outcome is not provided at all."

    "text": "2.3 Difficulty in webscraping\nEach university website is unique. Sometimes the information is not straightforward. An example of this is University of Adelaide’s course website. The main website for the degree does contain the list of units that go into the degree.\nHowever, instead of having just one page with all the unit information, the link takes you to a page with different unit information depending on when the unit is offered and on what campus.\nTina tried bypassing the pages by directly looking at the url of the final unit information page I want to be on. Unfortunately, the url is not designed or structured in a way which she was able to predict the url based on the current unit code. With that said, her only option was to code the function to jump from pages to pages before landing on the right unit information page.\nIt is also often found that the unit overview and learning outcomes for each unit within the same university could vary slightly in format. For example, unit overview may appears before or after campus location at University of Western Australia, empty spaces could be found after section title at the University of Melbourne, which would break the chain of extracting corresponding information."

For the purpose of this report, only 29 variables were looked at, including jobId, jobTitle, jobClassification, mobileAdTemplate, 25 programming languages. Of all the job posts, 535 are for senior or managerial positions, 25 for graduate positions, and the rest not specified in the job title.\nCondylios also included Data Analyst job posting in the data set. 92 jobs are for Data Analyst and 82 jobs are labeled Data Analyst/Data Scientist.

Of all the words, many of them will just be stop words which offers no insight. Hence, it is important to remove those stop words. We inspect the words after this step and realized that many of the “words” that were tokenized were actually just numbers. Therefore we filter the data to remove them. If we stop at this stage, we will see that many words are being under counted. For example “student” and “students” will be seen as two different words an counted separately, when in reality they are the same. The singularize() function singularizes words to fix this problem. However, we also noticed that this is not enough. Thus we usedwordStem()to stem the words in attempt to get the root form. This does not necessarily mean to reduce the word into the dictionary root. Instead, we want to stem it only so much to remove the tenses of the word. For example “work”, “works”, and “worked” will al be stemmed to “work.”\nEach unit and job description has raw text of varying lengths. If we just take the count of words directly, sometimes a word can be falsely inflated to occur a number of times due to the topic under which it is discussed. Therefore, we only allow the unique words of each unit /job description to included in the final count.\nWe check the words after each processes and sometimes manually remove words when we find it bring more noise than actual insight. Here is an example code of the pre-processing for unit outcomes.\nsinglewords <- unidata %>% \n  unnest_tokens(word, Outcomes)%>% \n  filter(!(word1 %in% stop_words$word)) %>% \n  subset(!grepl(\"[0-9]\", word1)) %>% \n  mutate(word = wordStem(word, language = \"english\")) %>%\n  distinct(School, Unit, word)"

manually using the code listed below. We made certain choices though it should be noted that the grouping is not 100% accurate. For example, the code ‘DATA’ from the University of Sydney is all classified under IT, however, some of the units that start with DATA are taught by the faculty in the School of Mathematics and Statistics (based on personal knowledge), which means ‘DATA’ belongs to multiple departments. Although there would be misclassified units, the results could still provide a meaningful guidance regarding the teaching components of Master of Data Science at Go8 universities.\nmath <- c(\"STAT\", \"MATH\", \"MATHS\", \"STATS\", \"MAT\", \"MAST\", \"ACTL\", \"QBUS\")\nit <- c(\"COMP\", \"FIT\", \"CITS\", \"INFS\", \"COSC\", \"CSSE\", \"CSYS\", \"EDPC\", \"INMT\", \"PHIL\", \"PHYS\", \"BUSN\",\"DATA\", \"INFO\", \"INFS\")\ncommerce <- c(\"ECON\", \"FINS\", \"MARK\", \"ACCT\", \"FINM\", \"MGMT\", \"MKTG\")\nspatial <- c(\"GEOM\", \"ITLS\")\nscience <- c(\"EDUC\", \"SCIE\", \"SOCR\")\nhealth <- c(\"BINF\", \"BMS\", \"HTIN\", \"PUBH\")\nIt is clear from Figure 5.1 that IT and Stat/Math are the two dominating components in the Master of Data Science degrees at Go8. Most units (165 out of 298) fall under the IT faculty, followed by Math and Stats, which has 79 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Teaching Content by Faculty\n\n\n\n\nSimilar findings could be observed from some but not all Go8 universities. Figure 5.2 shows a heat map of the faculty breakdown by university. Since the total number of units offered by each university is different, instead of showing the actual number, proportions are plotted to make better comparisons across universities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Proportion of IT Units Varys Across Go8 Universities\n\n\n\n\nLighter colour represents higher proportion, it is obvious that at Monash University (monash), University of Adelaide (Uuade), University of Sydney (usyd) and University of Western Australia (uwa), units from IT faculty occupies more than 50% of the total units offered, especially at Monash University, the proportion of IT units nearly reaches 87%.\nOn the other hand, University of Melbourne (unimelb) and University of Queensland (uq) offers relatively higher proportion of statistical and mathematical (Stat/Math) units, almost the same percentage as IT units. Whereas units offered at the Australian National University (anu) and UNSW Sydney (unsw) are more evenly distributed across IT, Stat/Math, Science/Social Science and Commerce respectively.\nIn addition, it is also clear that units offered at University of Melbourne (unimelb), University of Queensland (uq) and University of Western Australia (uwa) covers five out of eight categories, which implies the Master of Data Science degrees at these three universities provide more varieties in terms of units offered.\nBased on the findings above, it seems that there is a shared structure across Go8 that Master of Data Science is a IT based, computational degree, but the proportion it occupies varies by universities. Monash University tends to be heavily focused on IT and computational aspects, whereas the Master of Data Science degree at UNSW Sydney and ANU are more balanced across IT, statistics and math, as well as science and commerce."

    "text": "5.2 Unit Overview and Learning Outcome - Bigram\nAfter having a rough idea of the bigger picture, we then moved to explore what exactly are the teaching contents. We pre-processed text from learning outcome and unit overview to produce single word analysis, bigram, and tirgram. Words and terms such as ‘student’, ‘successful completion’ add more noises than values to the results, are removed in the pre-processing step.\nThe bigram, shown in Figure 5.3 below provides the most informative results among the n-gram analysis. Machine learning (machin learn) appears quite often, as well as software development (softwar develop), linear model, statistical analysis (statist analysi), spatial data. It seems that these frequently mentioned terms are associated with both computational and statistical concepts and skills, which aligns with the findings from the unit code analysis in previous section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Unit Overview and Learning Outcome - Bigram (n > 4)\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, due to the limited number of observations in the collected data set, the count for each term is too low to make meaningful interpretations or justifications. In addition, similar terms such as research findings, research designs and research literature are supposed to be grouped and counted together, but are not in the bigram. This issue is later solved by introducing the topic modeling technique for natural language processing, which will be discussed in Topic Modelling section."

From this bigram, the popular skills or knowledge mentioned are machin learn, predict model, communic skill, data analyt and data mine. Mathematical skill, mathemat statist is also mentioned quite often. Some of these terms on the list are vague and can mean be grouped together. Trigram yielded similar results as the bigram.

    "text": "As mentioned in Section Section 5.2, since the collected university data is relatively small, to make more educated and meaningful interpretations, similar words shall be grouped together and counted by groups. This is usually computed using text corpus, which is a language resource consisting of a large and structured set of texts, since data science is a new term waiting to be defined, there is no available text corpus on this topic. Therefore, we adopted the concept of word embedding models and tried to build our own text corpus.\nThere are multiple publicly available models and packages to conduct similar computations, such as word2vec and text2vec, however, each model takes hours to fit. Due to time constrains, we have only fitted the Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model with a few parameter adjustments using the text2vec package with the concepts illustrated by Das (2016)."

LDA then fits a probabilistic model that assumes a mixture of latent topics, where each topic has a multinomial distribution for all words. The number of topics is a parameter that could be adjusted by needs.\nThe model must be trained before it could be used, we web scraped 4448 Wikipedia articles as training data, including 2816 articles in statistics, 1005 articles in sociology and 627 in computing. The initial codes and functions to build the LDA model was provided by Dr Tanaka, we have tested model outputs using different number of topics and tried out training the LDA models with different combinations of data.\nThe table below shows a glimpse of the model output of the initial LDA model, after training by data collected from all 4448 Wikipedia articles on 12 topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n

extracted from the training data (Wikipedia articles), as each latent topic has a multinomial distribution for all words, beta value of a term is the score / probability computed for that particular topic. Highest beta value indicates highest probability, which means the term is most likely belongs to the corresponding topic.\nBeta values for the same word would differ from model to model, and also subject to change by adjusting the number of latent topics. To acquire the most satisfactory results for our university data, we have fitted and tested multiple LDA models with different subset of training data, as well as various number of topics."

On the top right, Model B demonstrates a better picture: Topics B6, B8 and B9 are the top 3 topics across all Go8 universities, however, proportions of Topics B10, B5, B7, B3 and B4 are also obvious higher in some of the universities, brings in difficulties to make justifications.\nAs sociology data tends to brings in noises to the model, and is not closely relevant to the data science topic compare with statistics and computing, Model C and D are fitted using only statistics data and computing data respectively. Topic C2 is the only dominating topic in Model C, where as Topics D6 and D1 occupy significantly large proportion in Model D. Besides, cccccc together took a relatively higher proportion compare with the rest of other topics in Model D.\nThe table below listed the top 30 words of each topics in Model C, it turns out Topic C2 contains words like comput (computation, computational, computer), system, program, machin (machine), softwar (software), model, test, calcul (calculate, calculation) and data, which seems to be associated with mainly computational aspects.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Topic C1 \n    Topic C2 \n    Topic C3 \n    Topic C4 \n    Topic C5 \n    Topic C6 \n    Topic C7 \n    Topic C8 \n    Topic C9 \n    Topic C10 \n  \n \n\n  \n    window \n    comput \n    ibm \n    algorithm \n    network \n    bit \n    format \n    intel \n    softwar \n    languag \n  \n  \n    system \n    system \n    comput \n    can \n    use \n    instruct \n    use \n    chip \n    compani \n    program \n  \n  \n    version \n    program \n    system \n    number \n    can \n    memori \n    imag \n    design \n    appl \n    use \n  \n  \n    releas \n    use \n    disk \n    function \n    web \n    use \n    digit \n    processor \n    free \n    compil \n  \n  \n    support \n    machin \n    drive \n    set \n    data \n    address \n    can \n    bit \n    use \n    code \n  \n  \n    user \n    design \n    use \n    state \n    internet \n    regist \n    video \n    core \n    also \n    function \n  \n  \n    oper_system \n    process \n    control \n    languag \n    secur \n    processor \n    standard \n    mhz \n    develop \n    object \n  \n  \n    oper \n    develop \n    machin \n    use \n    access \n    oper \n    disc \n    use \n    open \n    type \n  \n  \n    os \n    inform \n    card \n    symbol \n    protocol \n    can \n    data \n    introduc \n    sourc \n    can \n  \n  \n    file \n    softwar \n    unit \n    problem \n    link \n    data \n    file \n    microprocessor \n    user \n    implement \n  \n  \n    microsoft \n    engin \n    amiga \n    grammar \n    connect \n    system \n    encod \n    technolog \n    aol \n    program_languag \n  \n  \n    use \n    first \n    pc \n    rule \n    server \n    page \n    dvd \n    motorola \n    public \n    standard \n  \n  \n    applic \n    time \n    model \n    parser \n    servic \n    mode \n    edit \n    clock \n    state \n    charact \n  \n  \n    includ \n    research \n    storag \n    recurs \n    standard \n    architectur \n    pdf \n    power \n    new \n    exampl \n  \n  \n    develop \n    can \n    data \n    one \n    devic \n    also \n    code \n    ghz \n    hacker \n    class \n  \n  \n    unix \n    logic \n    commodor \n    input \n    node \n    set \n    cd \n    bus \n    project \n    also \n  \n  \n    mac \n    scienc \n    home \n    exampl \n    communic \n    one \n    camera \n    cpu \n    includ \n    name \n  \n  \n    command \n    work \n    hardwar \n    machin \n    provid \n    code \n    audio \n    generat \n    year \n    call \n  \n  \n    interfac \n    model \n    game \n    ture \n    attack \n    access \n    compress \n    perform \n    licens \n    line \n  \n  \n    also \n    oper \n    one \n    comput \n    may \n    byte \n    ray \n    support \n    law \n    variabl \n  \n  \n    dos \n    perform \n    oper \n    two \n    key \n    onli \n    also \n    seri \n    product \n    data \n  \n  \n    server \n    one \n    time \n    follow \n    also \n    program \n    includ \n    base \n    us \n    list \n  \n  \n    featur \n    test \n    atari \n    ani \n    client \n    comput \n    blu \n    product \n    open_sourc \n    includ \n  \n  \n    appl \n    calcul \n    ii \n    pars \n    system \n    execut \n    blu_ray \n    model \n    free_softwar \n    java \n  \n  \n    run \n    data \n    tape \n    context \n    browser \n    cpu \n    graphic \n    first \n    game \n    statement \n  \n  \n    base \n    univers \n    graphic \n    time \n    user \n    store \n    allow \n    cach \n    servic \n    valu \n  \n  \n    shell \n    mani \n    market \n    defin \n    page \n    point \n    print \n    market \n    busi \n    develop \n  \n  \n    linux \n    human \n    product \n    express \n    messag \n    number \n    media \n    two \n    technolog \n    interpret \n  \n  \n    manag \n    electron \n    display \n    string \n    applic \n    unit \n    store \n    famili \n    announc \n    structur \n  \n  \n    new \n    method \n    cp \n    onli \n    ethernet \n    perform \n    record \n    mb \n    work \n    support \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Model D provides a reasonably meaningful result, there is not much interpretations could be made for the other topics, the information it offers is still not very satisfying.

Therefore, Model D, which is trained by only statistics data on ten topics, is selected to use for further analysis on our university data.\nNote that it requires highly skilled linguists and huge efforts to establish a proper text corpus, the model we built is still fairly basic and could be further optimised by adjustments.\n\n\n\n\nDas, Sanjiv Ranjan. 2016. “Data Science: Theories, Models, Algorithms, and Analytics.” Learning 143: 145."

are related to math and statistics, and also more on the computational side of them, such as hypothesis testing and probability.\nThe results above further proves the earlier findings discussed in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2: Master of Data Science degrees offered at Go8 universities tend to be mainly IT based, the major components are computational as well as statistical/mathematical aspects.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Proportion Breakdown by Topic\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3 demonstrates a breakdown by topics instead of universities, it is clear that compares with the results based on only faculty in Section 5.1, the differences between Go8 are not as much here. The proportions occupied by the eight universities under each topic are fairly similar to each other, indicating the subjective choice made regarding the grouping method in Section 5.1 might have provided a slightly misleading information, but it would require further explorations to confirm whether it is truly the case."

While Topic 6 and 5 collectively takes up a large portion.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Topics Proportion by Job Classification\n\n\n\n\nSince the same LDA model is being applied, the breakdown of words in each topic can be found in Figure 7.2. Topic 1 has data and statist in its top 10 words, which are also popular words found in Figure 6.1. Topics 1, 6, 5 are all computational and some statistical elements. Hence we can conclude that both the employers universities have a more computational approach to data science. However, the magnitude of effect for the difference in proportion of topics is not being measured here."

    "text": "In this project, we collected university data and employer data to conduct analysis. For the university data, we used web scraping techniques to build our data set from scratch. Then, in depth exploratory data analysis was conducted. Finally, to try and solve problems we encountered during the analysis, we built LDA models through web scraping over 4000 Wikipedia articles to establish our own ‘text corpus’\nFrom the exploratory data analysis, we find that Master of Data Science degrees offered at Go8 are mostly dominated by computational component, even the statistical aspects of it are more computational. There is no obvious standard structure or skill set for data science degrees across Go8. Hence we fail to give a definite answer on what is universities’ definition of data science in Australia. The employer’s data offered us insight to the type of programming languages are favored by employers. We find that Python, R and SQL are the dominating ones. Data visualization is an important skill from employers’ perspective since it appears frequently in Figure 6.2 and Tableau is quite popular in Figure 6.3.\nThrough the application of LDA model, trained with only statistical data, we saw the breakdown of topics for employers and for universities are slightly different. However, we lack the data and tools to measure if the difference is significant."

    "text": "9.2 Limitation\nThe research has a few limitations. The lack of data consistency within Go8 universities lead to the small data size which made it difficult to measure the significance the analysis. Without information on programming languages taught at universities, we were not able to draw direct comparison with employers.\nWe assumed the nature of units (computational, statistical..etc.) based on the unit code when in reality the unit code is not a definite measure of the content being taught. Our assumption that the content is implied by unit code may be wrong.\nA proper text corpus requires great understanding of linguistics and a large amount of articles. The result of our LDA model topic breakdown can also simply be due to the fact that only a few of the wiki-articles we used are relevant and therefore will consistently be significant for employer and university data. In addition, there are latex terms included in the training data acquired through the web scraping process, these terms are not fully removed and might have brought unwanted noises to the fitted model, and possibly twisted the outputs.\nWe relied heavily on packages like tidytext and SnowballC for word processing. However, there still are some drawbacks. The stemmed words are still potentially not “clean” enough and produce misleading results."

Also, more thought can be put into the employer data collection. A different approach to obtaining employer data can be considered so that the two data set is more comparable. Considering Business analyst, data scientist, and data engineer positions. Should these positions be put into one data set? Last but not least, more experiments should be done with the LDA model. Such as, using different weights for the model parameters. Other articles can also be used to train the model. Other methodologies to convert text data into numerical data (eg. word2vec) can also be experimented."
